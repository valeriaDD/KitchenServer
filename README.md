## Laboratory work for network programming class
### Kitchen Server section
___ 
To start the project make sure you have the Dining Hall Server cloned and then run 
```docker-compose up``` inside Dining Hall Server folder</br>

The purpose of this task is for you to write a somewhat realistic ***simulation of how a restaurant works***.
The general idea is that you have ```Dining hall``` and ```Kitchen```.

The Dining hall generates orders and gives these ```orders``` to the Kitchen which prepares them and returns prepared
orders back to the Dining hall.

Based on your implementation, the restaurant simulation will get a reputation, based on all orders prepared during the
simulation. It indicates the success of your implementation.
